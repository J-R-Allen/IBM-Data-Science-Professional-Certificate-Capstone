# IBM_Data_Science_Capstone
Throughout this capstone I applied my data science skills as a Data scientist for a private space launch company in this project.    

As a starting point of my data science project, I collected data, as much and relevant as possible.

I collected data from various sources. After raw data was collected, I needed to improve the quality by performing data wrangling. 

I then started exploring the processed data. I explored some really interesting real-world datasets. I was able to practice my SQL skills as I query the data and gathered insights.  

I gained further insights into the data by applying some statistical analysis and data visualization, I was able to see directly how variables might be related to each other.   

I needed to drill down into finer levels of detail by splitting the data into groups defined by categorical variables or factors in my data.  

I then built, evaluated, and refined predictive models for discovering more exciting insights. 

The final task of this capstone project was to create a presentation that will be developed into stories of all my analysis.

## Key Topics Covered are: 
* Data Collection
* Data Wrangling
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Interactive Visual Analytics and Dashboard
* Predictive Analysis (Classification)
* Presentation of Insights through Powerpoint
